											<h2>Overview</h2>

											<p>In the last decade, the spreading of low-cost technologies integrating sensors and 
												actuators has favored the development of the so-called smart objects. This trend has 
												been further fostered by the Internet of Things (IoT), which connects the physical 
												world with the Internet via ubiquitous sensors and actuators.</br>
												The opportunities offered by the IoT are amplified by the use of new approaches 
												that, based on novel interaction paradigms, involve directly non-technical users in 
												configuring the joint behavior of their smart objects, among them and with online 
												services. Existing solutions to define the behavior of such “IoT ecosystems” range 
												from systems that leave the users complete control for establishing the joint behavior 
												of smart objects, to solutions that automatically define smart objects behavior exploiting intelligent techniques. In this continuum, different technologies, frameworks, and 
												approaches present different levels of user control and automation. In this perspective,
												it is also important to consider the emerging role played by social and humanoid robots, which are integrated sets of sensors and actuators with human-like behaviors.
												Given the diffusion and the relevance that these approaches have been gaining, this 
												workshop aims to serve as a venue for discussing ongoing research and sharing ideas 
												for researchers and practitioners working on solutions to personalize the behavior of 
												IoT ecosystems.</p>

											<h2>Submissions</h2>

											<p> We invite submissions of two types: short papers (3-4 pages) and
												position papers (1-2 pages). Participants are asked to submit their
												paper describing their recent or future work in one of the areas
												indicated in the topics of interest. All submissions must be in the
												CHI Extended Abstracts format (<a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/" target="_blank">https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/</a>).
